      <h1>Welcome!</h1>
      <p>Far away in the tranquil countryside, a penguin named Nis 
        found her new home. Once a high-powered, successful city dweller, she 
        thrived on health, wealth, and wisdom. Despite her glamorous lifestyle, Nis 
        felt an emptiness and longed for peace.</p>

      <p> One autumn morning, she left the bustling city behind, 
        seeking a simpler, more fulfilling life. In the countryside, 
        surrounded by rolling hills and blooming wildflowers, Nis discovered 
        true joy. She woke to the melody of birds, tended to her charming garden, 
        and embraced the slow, serene pace of rural life.</p>
        
      <p> Here, Nis found the peace and contentment she had always yearned for, 
        living harmoniously with nature and the kind-hearted villagers. The 
        countryside became her sanctuary, where she lived a rich, fulfilling life, 
        filled with quiet wisdom and happiness. </p>

      <p> Join Nis on her journey to tranquility and discover the beauty of
        a simple life. </p>
